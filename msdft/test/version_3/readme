In this version we try to achieve stability in the system
in order to do that, when the multiplication with the 
twiddle factors takes place we keep all the bits, because
the algorithm stands after the initialization period inside
the resonator there is a perfect subtraction between the 
sample taken at N-1 cycles.

ie you want the term [(x(n)-x(n-N))*twidd - resonator] be exact
in order to eliminate the sample x(n-N) inside the resonator.

To do that we diminish the bitwidth of the twiddle factor 
to 9_7 bits.----> this generate at most a sinewave  with 
6*8=48dB of snr, so is a compromise between the dynamic range
 i want to achieve and the stability of the system



..Still is unstable :(
